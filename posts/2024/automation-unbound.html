        <p>
            That's my definition of automation. What is yours? What do you think
            and feel when you hear this word? Are you afraid that robots will
            wipe us all out? Or maybe you live your life believing that humans
            will live in prosperity and will never have to work again?
        </p>

        <p>
            We all come from different backgrounds and have different
            personality traits inscribed into our DNAs, so it's natural that we
            have our own experiences and biases that shape our understanding and
            perception of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this article, I'm not going to persuade you, my dear reader, to
            fall in love with automation. I'm simply here to deliver a message:
            <b>automation is inevitable</b>. It has evolved from simple
            mechanical tools to complex AI systems, fundamentally changing how
            we work and live today. It's convenient. It's affordable. It's
            life-changing. And it's everywhere, whether we like it or not.
        </p>

        <p>
            To be clear: I don't think we're getting wiped out by an army of
            robots controlled by a superintelligence anytime soon<sup><a href="#footnote-1" class="footnote-ref"
                    id="footnote-ref-1">1</a></sup>. But to <b>survive in the
                economical sense</b>, we cannot take anything we do for granted.
            That's what the history of automation teaches us.

        <p>
            I spent many evenings thinking about technological progress and came
            to a simple conclusion: <b>automation has been a gradual process</b>
            for the past 6,000 years. What's interesting about it is that the
            complexity of the human effort being outsourced kept increasing over
            time.
        </p>

        <p>
            We started automating physical labor first around 4,000 B.C. because
            it was the easiest thing to start with. Simple mechanical tools like
            wheels, levers, and pulleys hadn't required complex technology to
            already be in place in order to be invented. Even though these tools
            still need human effort (so it's not fully outsourced), they vastly
            enhance our capabilities. To me, <b>enhancement is the lower bound
                for the automation</b>, so it counts ü´£
        </p>

        <div class="content-separator"></div>

        <p>
            The world had to wait almost six thousand (!) years for a
            revolutionary innovation in the physical labor space, namely: a
            steam engine.
        </p>

        <p>
            What took them so long? üòÖ
        </p>

        <p>
            To be fair, building a steam engine requires significantly more
            creativity than picking up a large stick and using it as a lever for
            heavy stones. But hey, the wait was worth it: steam engines
            kick-started industrial revolution, which led to widespread
            mechanization, eventually landing our civilization with infinitely<sup><a href="#footnote-2"
                    class="footnote-ref" id="footnote-ref-2">2</a></sup> complex artifacts: fully autonomous, robotized
            factories. Something
            even the brightest minds of 4,000 B.C. wouldn't imagine in their
            wildest dreams.

        <h2 id="second-era-calculation">Second era: calculation</h2>

        <p>
            To <b>calculate</b> means to <b>count</b>. Calculation can be as
            simple as finding a number of something using your fingers, but also
            as complex as preparing a financial statement for the company.
            Humans have been counting for thousands of years for multiple
            reasons, for example:
        </p>

        <ul class="article-list">
            <li>to keep track of the level of grain in food reservoirs,</li>
            <li>to collect taxes,</li>
            <li>or... to weave.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You may have not thought about it this way, but weaving a textile is
            a very specific form of calculation - a person needs to track and
            remember the "state" of the weaving device to adjust his/her actions
            accordingly. Up to 1800s, a human being was necessary for this type
            of calculation to occur. In some cases it was a blocker.
        </p>

        <p>
            To make weaving process more flexible and robust, a Jacquard loom
            has been invented. This machine could conduct a very specific form
            of calculation and, as a result, automatically produce any
            pre-configured type of textile pattern. Not only did it change the
            weaving industry forever, but its configuration method using punched
            cards was also widely adopted and eventually led to the emergence of
            programmable computers introduced by IBM.
        </p>

        <p>
            Jacquard loom could automatically calculate, and to <b>automatically
                calculate means to compute</b>. Does this mean it was the first
            computer?

            The western world is in the middle of full-scale industrial
            automation. Physical labor of workers is already significantly
            automated, but computation is still in its early days. Computing
            machines are huge (like an entire room), and miserably slow. It was
            this point in history when homo sapiens was like:

            another extraordinarily complex artifact: a data center. Data
            centers are to computation what factories are to physical labor.

        <h2 id="third-era-intelligence">Third era: intelligence</h2>

        <p>
            Do you remember when I mentioned that throughout the centuries, the
            complexity of effort we are able to automate increases? It still
            holds, especially in the 2020s. Physical labor is automated.
            Calculation is automated. What is left? What else has economical
            value but is expensive to do?
        </p>

        <p>
            Intelligence.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some say we're living in the age of information. We do, yeah, but
            information is just part of the story. The real economical value of
            all that data comes from the insights it hides. And what is needed
            to uncover them? Intelligence. That's why <b>I think we're rather
                living in the age of intelligence</b>. Intelligence brings a
            tremendous value to any human activity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Automating intellectual effort requires complex artifacts like data
            centers and clever software. That's why the concept of automated
            intelligence had to patiently wait in the back row for thousands of
            years - without unimaginably powerful hardware and the internet as
            the data source for novel algorithms, it simply couldn't become the
            thing. Not anymore - we're slowly, but steadily entering this third
            era of automation.
        </p>

        <div class="content-separator"></div>

        <p>
            Intelligence can take a direct or an indirect form.

        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Direct intelligence</b> is when an intelligent being reasons
            about a given topic and is able to draw conclusions about it.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Indirect intelligence</b>, on the other hand, is when that
            intelligent being produces an artifact (e.g. software) that can
            replicate intelligent behavior, but without requiring its creator to
            act in any form other than ensuring the artifact is turned on.
        </p>

        <p>
            There's this one thing that bothers me about the indirect
            intelligence, though: what if the artifact created by the
            intelligent, biological being (homo sapiens) becomes an intelligent,
            synthetic being? Should we keep treating it as an artifact just
            because it's synthetic, or adjust our perception and admit we've
            created true artificial intelligence?
        </p>

        <p>
            It seems that it comes down to how we define what a <b>being</b> is.
            Is anything that is self-aware a being? If so, then how do we know
            if the being is really self-aware? Maybe it just says it is but it
            simply mocks us?
        </p>

        <p>
            I honestly don't know.
        </p>

        <div class="content-separator"></div>

        <p>
            It is humbling to observe how automation has been shaping our
            civilization throughout the millenia.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, physical labor... outsourced.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, calculation... done.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nowadays, the very thing that makes humans humans - intellect...
            work in progress.
        </p>

        <p>
            What's next?
        </p>

        <p>
            Our new reality demands us to adapt. I see it as a modern twist on
            the natural selection mechanism. This time, however, homo sapiens is
            not challenged by other biological species. Instead, we're
            witnessing a rise of virtual beings engraved into silicon, wandering
            through computational clouds, performing calculation with
            unimaginable speed and precision, and being active 24/7 (well,
            almost!). Never tired, always obedient to their creators. At least
            for now ü´£
