            Our <b>problem has been defined</b> as follows:
        </p>

        <div class="key-concept">
            How to deploy an app to multiple environments so that each env can run a
            different version of the application?
        </div>

        <p>
            Firstly, based on the analysis of the problem and a tiny bit of
            additional specification, we’ve concluded with the following <b>list
                of requirements</b>:
        </p>

        <ol class="article-list">
            <li>Git flow must be a no-brainer – we don’t want to deal with
                multiple branches that will have to be frequently synchronized.
            </li>
            <li>Application needs to be versioned.</li>
            <li>It must be possible to deploy the required version of the
                application to the selected deployment environment.</li>
            <li>Every environment runs only one version of the application at the
                same time.</li>
            <li>[bonus] automate manual processes to a reasonable extent.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            With these in mind, we’ve brainstormed various approaches that could
            be used to fulfill the requirements.
        </p>


        <p>
            📋 <b>req #1: repository branching & development strategy:</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            option #1: git-flow
            <br>
            option #2: pure trunk-based
            <br>
            option #3: permissive trunk-based
        </p>

        <p>
            📋 <b>req #2: application versioning:</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            option #1: git tagging
            <br>
            option #2: containers with tagging
        </p>

        <p>
            📋 <b>req #3: configurable deployment environments:</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            option #1: config files
            <br>
            option #2: helm charts
            <br>
            option #3: branch-based deployment
        </p>

        <div class="content-separator"></div>

        <h1 id="scope">🎯 Scope</h1>

        <p>
            I call the third step of my problem solving process <i>scoping</i>.
        </p>

        <div class="key-concept">
            The goal here is to look at the list of requirements and the options for
            their solutions to pick the one that will be implemented.
        </div>

        <p>

            You can treat is as the symbolic conclusion of the design process.
            When done properly, scoping should let you implement a functional
            PoC. Keep in mind that the solutions you pick may lead to issues
            that you haven’t predicted. In such cases, it may be necessary to go
            back and re-scope the options to pick another alternative. And it’s
            okay. Remember–software development is an iterative process!
        </p>

        <p>
            I’d say that <b>the number of times when it’s necessary to go back
                and forth between the implementation and scoping phases is inversely
                proportional to the experience you have in the field</b> – the more
            exposition you get to various problems, the better your designs and
            predictions, thus the less iteration is necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            With that, let’s scope, requirement by requirement.
        </p>

        <div class="content-separator"></div>

        <h2 id="req-1-no-brainer-git-flow">📋 req #1: No-brainer git flow</h2>

        <p>
            option #1: git-flow
            <br>
            option #2: pure trunk-based
            <br>
            <b>👉🏼 option #3: permissive trunk-based</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            The choice is easy: git-flow is too complex for our use case as we
            don’t want to deal with multiple branches that will have to be
            frequently synchronized. Pure trunk-based development is a little
            bit too hardcore when it comes to working in slightly larger teams
            and requires automated CI upfront. Permissive trunk-based approach
            with short-lived feature branches will be a perfect choice. It
            strikes great balance between the complexity and efficiency 👌🏼.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you’re interested, you can read about considered options <a
                href="one-branch-to-rule-them-all-1.html#req-1-no-brainer-git-flow">in
                the previous post</a>.
        </p>

        <div class="content-separator"></div>

        <h2 id="req-2-application-needs-to-be-versioned">📋 req #2: Application needs to be versioned</h2>

        <p>
            👉🏼 <b>option #1: git tagging</b>
            <br>
            👉🏼 <b>option #2: containers with tagging</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Didn’t expect that one! To be honest, the main solution that I’m
            going to pick is option #2. As mentioned in the brainstorming step,
            introducing containerization to your project has a lot of benefits
            and its worth every minute invested in. It will allow the
            application to be versioned conveniently, plus the execution
            environment will be clearly defined. Win-win.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, we’ll also introduce git tagging.
        </p>

        <p>
            Why?
        </p>

        <p>
            To make it easier to check out the code to specific version of the
            application to play/analyze/debug it. It’s much easier and faster to
            check out to a specific git tag than to spin up a container. Plus,
            application containers are (at least should) be <i>minimal</i>,
            meaning that no additional tools for testing/debugging should be
            included within them. This is what makes it more challenging to
            debug the code from within them, hence local check out may be handy
            in many situations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Read more about the options <a
                href="one-branch-to-rule-them-all-1.html#req-2-application-needs-to-be-versioned">here</a>.
        </p>

        <div class="content-separator"></div>

        <h2 id="req-3-4-configurable-deployment-environments">📋 req #3-4: Configurable deployment targets</h2>

        <p>
            👉🏼 <b>option #1: config files</b>
            <br>
            👉🏼 option #2: helm charts
            <br>
            👉🏼 option #3: branch-based deployment
        </p>

        <p>
            Firstly, let’s go with the easy one to REJECT: helm charts. As part
            of this tutorial, we’re not going to build anything that will be
            deployed to Kubernetes, hence the decision. Nonetheless, the
            proposed solution will be Kubernetes-compatible to a certain degree.
        </p>

        <p>
            Secondly, branch-based deployment. Our selected branching strategy
            is “permissive trunk-based development”. We’ll have one main
            branch, and allow for several short-lived feature branches. That’s
            all. Branch-based deployment strategy would require long-lived
            branches other than the main itself (e.g. develop, etc.). There are
            no such branches allowed, so branch-based deployment goes to trash.
        </p>

            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            What’s left is the approach leveraging config files. It’s simple,
            versatile, and effective, and will fit our design perfectly.
        </p>

        <p>
            Details on all the options are <a

        <div class="content-separator"></div>

        <p>
            Uff, scoping done! 😅
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, the only thing left is to implement and test all of that.
            Easy-peasy [sarcasm]
        </p>

        <h1 id="implement-test">👨🏻‍💻 Implement & test</h1>

        <p>
            I’ve divided this phase into incremental steps so that it’s easier
            for you to see gradual improvements introduced to the code and the
            project overall, and how to fulfill certain requirements. The code
            is available on GitHub, check it out <a href="https://github.com/toolongautomated/tutorial-1">here</a>. For
            every implementation milestone, I’ve prepared a dedicated tag in the
            repository so that it’s easier for you to either checkout the code
            and play with it and, of course, fork it if that’s what you’d like
            to do.
        </p>


        <h2 id="reference-point">Reference point</h2>

        <p>
            Let’s start with the reference point of the project. Go to <a
                href="https://github.com/toolongautomated/tutorial-1/tree/1-reference-point">GitHub's
                UI</a> or run the command below on your machine to checkout the
            code:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-bash">
git checkout 1-reference-point
            </code>
        </pre>

        <br>
        <p>
            This is the state of the repository you’ve been given. We’ll take it from here. It contains some basic stuff
            like:
        </p>

        <ul class="article-list">

        </ul>

        <p>
            Ensure docker and Python are installed in your development
            environment, then install the requirements, and continue to either
            run the tests or the application locally. Refer to the <a
                href="https://github.com/toolongautomated/tutorial-1/tree/1-reference-point/README.md">README</a>

            Recap: we’ll use git tags and docker image tags to keep our application versioned. Let’s start with the tags
            as it’s easy to do.
        </p>

        <p>
            But first things first.
        </p>

        <p>
            We need a file that will be used to log all the changes introduced to our app. The file will be called…
        </p>

        <p>

        <p>
            💥 CHANGELOG.md 💥
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m a big fan of <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning
                scheme</a>. Sounds mysterious, but I bet I bet you’ve already seen
            this approach in action multiple times:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-bash">
&lt;MAJOR&gt;.&lt;MINOR&gt;.&lt;PATCH&gt; # e.g. "1.4.2"
            </code>
        </pre>

        <br>
        <p>
            What are these “major”, “minor”, and “patch”? Here’s an excerpt from
            the <a href="https://semver.org/#summary">docs</a>:
        </p>

        <ol class="article-list">
            <li><b>MAJOR</b> version when you make incompatible API changes</li>
            <li><b>MINOR</b> version when you add functionality in a backward
                compatible manner</li>
            <li><b>PATCH</b> version when you make backward compatible bug fixes</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            That’s the approach we’re going to follow in our change log.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now the important thing: when should you update the version of the
            application and introduce new entry in the change log?
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Whenever you add/remove/change any file strictly related to the
                application.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            This can be: source code, requirements, static files that are used
            by the application from within the container, this sort of things.
            It may be a bit hard to grasp in the beginning, but you’ll quickly
            learn to judge properly, I promise. Plus, that’s why there are other
            developers that will be reviewing your code to help build these
            intuitions 🙌🏼
        </p>

        <h3 id="git-tagging">git tagging</h3>

        <p>
            As mentioned before, you can think of <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging">git
                tags</a> as “named commits” – you can reference a specific point in
            repository’s git history using a human-friendly string, not commit’s
            SHA. At this point of implementation, we’re going to just define the
            rules for creating new git tags, not to automate it in any way.
            We’ll start with the following rule:
        </p>

        <div class="key-concept">
            🚨 <b>Rule:</b> whenever new version is put in the change log file
            and gets merged into the main branch, a corresponding git tag should
            be created.
        </div>

        <p>
            To make it crystal clear: you decide that the app will have version
            1.0.1 because there was one small backward-compatible bug that you
            fixed. What you should do:
        </p>

        <ol class="article-list">
            <li>Create new feature branch from the main branch.</li>
            <li>Fix the bug in the application and put new entry in the
                CHANGELOG.md file, briefly describing the change.</li>
            <li>Open PR to the main branch.</li>
            <li>Once approved, merge the code.</li>
            <li>Checkout main locally and pull the changes.</li>
            <li>Create a tag with the following command:
                <pre style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><code class="language-bash">git tag 1.0.1</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>Push the tag to the remote:
                <pre style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><code class="language-bash">git push --tags</code></pre>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="containerize-the-application">Containerize the application</h3>

        <p>
            Now is the perfect time to containerize our application. How?
        </p>

        <ul class="article-list">
            <li>wrap your app with <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>
                into a docker image</li>
            <li>build the image locally with a minimal, yet functional set of
                files required by the app to run properly
            </li>
            <li><b>[optional]</b> set up a docker image registry on Docker
                Hub</li>
            <li>push the image to the registry</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            To make app containerization as straightforward as possible, it is useful to first organize it into “a
            container-friendly” structure:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-plaintext">
app/
├── src/
├── test/
│   ├── integration/
│   └── unit/
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── requirements-test.txt
└── requirements.txt
            </code>
        </pre>

        <br>
        <p>
            I think it’s pretty self-explanatory, so let’s continue.
        </p>

        <p>
            We’ll add two files to this mix under the app directory: Dockerfile
            and .dockerignore. Since our application is a super simple Flask
            server, Dockerfile will be rather straightforward:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-dockerfile">
FROM python:3.10-slim

EXPOSE 80
ENV FLASK_APP=main.py

COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app/src

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /app/requirements.txt

CMD ["gunicorn", "-w", "4", "-b", "0.0.0.0:80", "main:app"]
            </code>
        </pre>

        <br>
        <p>
            And the corresponding .dockerignore (to ensure only the files that
            are essential for the server to run properly inside a container are
            copied to the image during the build procedure):
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-plaintext">
**/__pycache__/
.pytest_cache/

test/

requirements-test.txt
*.md

.dockerignore
Dockerfile
            </code>
        </pre>


        <br>
        <p>
            Note that test requirements are NOT put into the app container as
            they’re not needed there for the app to run correctly. If required,
            you may of course create a separate Dockerfile that would set up the
            container for testing purposes. I can imagine at least several use
            cases that would benefit from doing it, e.g. automating unit and/or
            integration tests execution and running them as Docker containers.
        </p>


        <p>
            Once added Docker-related files, app’s directory should now look
            like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-plaintext">
app/
├── src/
├── test/
│   ├── integration/
│   └── unit/
├── .dockerignore
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements-test.txt
└── requirements.txt
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            Believe me or not, but this will be enough to build Docker image
            with our application and publish it to the docker image registry.
        </p>

        <p>
            Run the following to build a docker image locally:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-bash">
cd app
docker build -t tutorial-1 .
            </code>
        </pre>

        <br>
        <p>
            The image will be called tutorial-1. To run it, use the following
            command:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-bash">
docker run --rm -p 80:80 tutorial-1
            </code>
        </pre>

        <br>
        <p>
            Note that the directory from which you are running the container is
            NOT important in this case. Docker container runs a Flask server
            inside, exposed to port 80 of the container. To make it available
            runs a Flask server inside, exposed to port 80 of the container. To
            make it available <b>outside of the container</b>, we need to
            forward this port to some other port outside of the container.
            That's what the -p flag does – it forwards container's port number
            80 to port 80 of the local machine.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once built, the image can be <b>pushed to an external registry</b>
            (a place on the Internet where your Docker images are stored). For
            this tutorial, I've prepared a helper <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/toolongautomated/tutorial-1">Docker
                Hub repository</a>. It’s <i>public</i>, meaning, you can <b>pull</b>
            the images from it without any limitations, however…
        </p>

        <div class="key-concept">
            <b>🚨 Disclaimer:</b> if you’d like to push your own docker images
            somewhere, you’ll need to set up your own Docker container
            registry. You can read more about setting up a Docker Hub repository
            <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/">here</a>.
        </div>


        <p>
            Okay, back to the gist.
        </p>

        <p>
            Where were we… ah, yes, building and pushing Docker images.
        </p>

        <p>
            To push the image, you need to first <b>authenticate</b> to your
            image registry of choice. In my case it's the Docker Hub, so I
            simply need to run:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-bash">
docker login
            </code>
        </pre>

        <br>
        <p>
            Next, let's <b>adjust the tags</b> of the image we've already built
            before (tutorial-1):
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-bash">
docker tag tutorial-1 toolongautomated/tutorial-1:1.0.0
            </code>
        </pre>

        <br>
        <p>
            Then, to <b>push</b> the built image:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-bash">
docker push toolongautomated/tutorial-1:1.0.0
            </code>
        </pre>

        <div class="content-separator"></div>

        <p>
            This concludes step 1 of our implementation efforts. We now have a
            clear git tagging process defined, and the app is containerized. I
            encourage you to spend some time with <a
                href="https://github.com/toolongautomated/tutorial-1/tree/2-application-versioning">the
                code</a> and read the README until you get comfortable with what you
            see there.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next on the agenda, final piece of the baseline requirements:
            configuration of multiple deployment targets. We'll talk about it in
            the next article.
