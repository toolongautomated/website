            On December 20th, OpenAI released o3 – second generation reasoning model. Here's why I think you should care

            o3's improvement over the GPT series proves that architecture is
            everything. You couldn't throw more compute at GPT-4 and get these
            results. Simply scaling up the things we were doing from 2019 to
            2023 – take the same architecture, train a bigger version on more
            data – is not enough. Further progress is about new ideas.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Chollet's blog post is the most interesting insight I found that
            shines new light onto the evaluation of the o3 model on the
            important general intelligence benchmark called ARC-AGI. Chollet
            made it a little bit technical, so I'll try to extract the essence
            of it into a more comprehensible form.
        </p>

        <h2>tl;dr</h2>

        <p>
            New o3 model from OpenAI is a breakthrough improvement over other
            models evaluated in the ARC-AGI benchmark (set of tasks the AI model
            has to solve in order to prove it has general intelligence). o3 is
            able to adapt to tasks it has never seen, and does so on nearly
            human-level.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here are its results, compared with the other models.

            A bunch of explanations:
        </p>

        <ul class="article-list">
            <li>
                <b>ARC-AGI semi-private eval</b> - a set of 100 tasks the model
                is requested to solve. Here, 76% score of o3 low (tuned) means
                that it successfully solved 76 of these tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>y axis</b> shows the score a given model achieved on the ARC-AGI

                <b>x axis</b> shows how much, on average, it cost to solve the
                task by the model (counted as the compute/API cost).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>"KAGGLE SOTA"</b> - the best model on the <a

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>"STEM GRAD"</b> - score the graduate student from the STEM
                field get on the benchmark
            </li>
            <li id="footnote-ref-1">
                <b>"LOW/MED/HIGH" next to "o1" and "o3" scores</b> - how hard
                the model is allowed to reason<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> about the task it is presented
                with. This directly corresponds to
                the <a
                    href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-reasoning_effort">reasoning_effort
                    parameter</a> from the OpenAI's API.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>"TUNED" (next to o3 scores)</b> - this is to denote that the o3 system has been trained on the
                ARC-AGI-1 Public Training set. Since it has some knowledge about the ARC-AGI data before the evaluation,
                it's considered to be tuned to the task.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="content-separator"></div>

        <p>
            I believe that even though o3 itself will not replace programmers, scientists, mathematicians, and others
            working in the STEM field, it definitely highlights the trend in the industry.
        </p>

        <p>
            It seems we're entering the phase in which there will exist strong models that will achieve human, or maybe
            even superhuman performance on very specific tasks (like coding).
        </p>

        <p>
            Is it good or maybe bad?
        </p>

        <p>
            It is what it is, to be honest. What is important is to stay on top of all of that.
        </p>

        <p>
            Are you afraid?
        </p>

        <p>
            I am. But I don't want to let this fear and uncertainty paralyze me. What helps me in such situations is to
            better understand what I'm dealing with. That often shows that my fear is caused by misunderstanding the
            situation, not by the situation itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's understand the o3 then, even just a little bit of what it is and what it does.
        </p>

        <h2>What is o3?</h2>

        <p>
            Models like GPT struggle with tasks they haven't seen in the
            training data because they lack true reasoning abilities. Their
            answers are generated using the same amount of compute, no matter
            how complex the problem they're solving is. This doesn't make sense,
            at least not in the way we understand true intelligence and what it
            takes to solve the problems. This "one-size-fits-all" approach works
            well for familiar tasks but sparks issues when faced with something
            genuinely new, as it prevents GPTs from adapting to the unknowns.
        </p>

        <p>
            Reasoning, on the other hand, involves breaking down a problem into
            smaller, manageable steps and exploring different solution paths.
            This is often called a <i>chain of thought</i> (CoT), where each
            step logically follows from the previous one, leading to a solution.
            GPTs were tricked to work this way by prompts like "think about it
            step by step", maybe you are familiar with this technique. It worked
            well, but had its limitations.
        </p>

        <p>
            o1 before, and now o3 represent a breakthrough because they leverage
            this reasoning process by design. Unlike GPT, o3 dynamically
            generates and evaluates different solution paths (chains of thought)
            to find the best approach for a given task, guided by the internal
            "evaluator model", probably in a way DeepMind's <a
                href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go/">AlphaZero</a>
            does its Monte Carlo tree search. This ability to adapt its
            computational effort based on the problem's complexity, a core
            feature of o3, is a significant shift from the fixed computation of
            previous models, moving AI closer to more human-like reasoning.
        </p>

        <p>
            Is o3 AGI? Chollet doesn't think so (and neither do I):
        </p>

        <div class="key-concept">
            Passing ARC-AGI does not equate to achieving AGI, and, as a matter
            of fact, I don't think o3 is AGI yet. o3 still fails on some very
            easy tasks, indicating fundamental differences with human
            intelligence.
            <br>

        </div>

        <h2>What is ARC-AGI and why is it important?</h2>

        <div class="key-concept">
            Most AI benchmarks measure skill. But skill is not intelligence.
            General intelligence is the ability to efficiently acquire new
            skills. Chollet's unbeaten 2019 Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for
            Artificial General Intelligence (<a href="https://arcprize.org/">ARC-AGI</a>) is the only formal
            benchmark of AGI progress. <br><br> It's easy for humans, but hard
            for AI. <br><br> ~ François Chollet [<a href="https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough">source</a>]
        </div>

        <p>
            You can read more about it <a href="https://arcprize.org/">here</a>,
            including <b>trying some of the challenges yourself</b>! I highly
            encourage you to do this! I bet you'll quickly understand that these
            are quite tricky, but still relatively easy for humans to grasp
            intuitively.
        </p>

        <p>
            This benchmark is one of a few that still haven't <i>saturated</i>,
            meaning that there's still space for improvement.
